<h3 dir='rt1'>2.1 Covering Your A** With Assertions</h3>
  
Sometimes a genuinely helpful language feature gets less attention than it deserves. For some reason, this is what happened to Python’s built-inassert statement.In this chapter I’m going to give you an introduction to using asser-tions in Python. You’ll learn how to use them to help automaticallydetect errors in your Python programs. This will make your programsmore reliable and easier to debug.At this point, you might be wondering “What are assertions and whatare they good for?” Let’s get you some answers for that.At its core, Python’s assert statement is a debugging aid that tests acondition. If the assert condition is true, nothing happens, and yourprogram continues to execute as normal. But if the condition evalu-ates to false, an Assertion Error exception is raised with an optional error message.

<h4 dir='rt1'>Assert in Python — An Example</h4>
  
Here’s a simple example so you can see where assertions might comein handy. I tried to give this some semblance of a real-world problem you might actually encounter in one of your programs.Suppose you were building an online store with Python. You’re work-ing to add a discount coupon functionality to the system, and eventu-ally you write the following apply_discount function:
  
``` python
def apply_discount(product, discount):
    price=int(product['price']*(1.0-discount))
    assert0<=price<=product['price']
    return price
```
Notice the assert statement in there? It will guarantee that, no mat-terwhat,discounted prices calculated by this function cannot be lower
$0 and they cannot be higher than the original price of the prod-uct.Let’s make sure this actually works as intended if we call this functionto apply a valid discount. In this example, products for our store willbe represented as plain dictionaries. This is probably not what you’ddo for a real application, but it’ll work nicely for demonstrating asser-tions. Let’s create an example product—a pair of nice shoes at a priceof $149.00:

``` python
>>> shoes={'name':'Fancy Shoes','price':14900}
```
  
By the way, did you notice how I avoided currency rounding issuesby using an integer to represent the price amount in cents? That’sgenerally a good idea... But I digress. Now, if we apply a 25% discountto these shoes, we would expect to arrive at a sale price of $111.75:
``` python
>>> apply_discount(shoes,0.25)
11175
```
Alright, this worked nicely. Now, let’s try to apply some invalid dis-counts. For example, a 200% “discount” that would lead to us givingmoney to the customer:
``` python
>>> apply_discount(shoes,2.0)
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File"<input>", line1,in<module>
    apply_discount(prod,2.0)
  File"<input>", line4,inapply_discount
    assert0<=price<=product['price']
  AssertionError
```
As you can see, when we try to apply this invalid discount, ourprogram halts with an AssertionError. This happens because adiscount of 200% violated the assertion condition we placed in theapply_discount function.
  
You can also see how the exception stacktrace point sout the exact line of code containing the failed assertion. If you (or another developeron your team) ever encounter one of these errors while testing theonline store, it will be easy to find out what happened just by lookingat the exception traceback.This speeds up debugging efforts considerably, and it will make your programs more maintainable in the long-run. And that, my friend, isthe power of assertions.

<h5 dir='rt1'>Why Not Just Use a Regular Exception?</h5>
  
Now, you’re probably wondering why I didn’t just use an if-statement
and an exception in the previous example…
You see, the proper use of assertions is to inform developers about
unrecoverable errors in a program. Assertions are not intended to
signal expected error conditions, like a File-Not-Found error, where
a user can take corrective actions or just try again.
Assertions are meant to be internal self-checks for your program. They
work by declaring some conditions as impossible in your code. If one
of these conditions doesn’t hold, that means there’s a bug in the program.
If your program is bug-free, these conditions will never occur. But if
they do occur, the program will crash with an assertion error telling
you exactly which “impossible” condition was triggered. This makes
it much easier to track down and fix bugs in your programs. And I like
anything that makes life easier—don’t you?
For now, keep in mind that Python’s assert statement is a debugging
aid, not a mechanism for handling run-time errors. The goal of using
assertions is to let developers find the likely root cause of a bug more
quickly. An assertion error should never be raised unless there’s a bug
in your program.
Let’s take a closer look at some other things we can do with assertions,
and then I’ll cover two common pitfalls when using them in real-world
scenarios.
  
<h5 dir='rt1'>Python’s Assert Syntax</h5>
  
It’s always a good idea to study up on how a language feature is actually implemented in Python before you start using it. So let’s take
a quick look at the syntax for the assert statement, according to the
Python docs:
  
``` python
assert_stmt ::= "assert" expression1 ["," expression2]
```
  
In this case, expression1 is the condition we test, and the optional
expression2 is an error message that’s displayed if the assertion fails.
At execution time, the Python interpreter transforms each assert statement into roughly the following sequence of statements:

``` python
if __debug__:
    if not expression1:
        raise AssertionError(expression2)
```

Two interesting things about this code snippet:
Before the assert condition is checked, there’s an additional check for
the __debug__ global variable. It’s a built-in boolean flag that’s true
under normal circumstances and false if optimizations are requested.
We’ll talk some more about later that in the “common pitfalls” section.
Also, you can use expression2 to pass an optional error message that
will be displayed with the AssertionError in the traceback. This can
simplify debugging even further. For example, I’ve seen code like this:
  
``` python
>>> if cond == 'x':
        do_x()

    elif cond == 'y':
        do_y()

    else:
        assert False, (
        'This should never happen, but it does '
        'occasionally. We are currently trying to '
        'figure out why. Email dbader if you '
        'encounter this in the wild. Thanks!')
````
  
Is this ugly? Well, yes. But it’s definitely a valid and helpful technique
if you’re faced with a Heisenbug2 in one of your applications.

<h5 dir='rt1'>Common Pitfalls With Using Asserts in Python</h5>
  
Before you move on, there are two important caveats regarding the
use of assertions in Python that I’d like to call out.
The first one has to do with introducing security risks and bugs into
your applications, and the second one is about a syntax quirk that
makes it easy to write useless assertions.
This sounds (and potentially is) quite horrible, so you should probably
at least skim these two caveats below.
  
<h5 dir='rt1'>Caveat #1 – Don’t Use Asserts for Data Validation</h5>
  
The biggest caveat with using asserts in Python is that assertions canbe globally disabled3with the-Oand-OOcommand line switches, aswell as thePYTHONOPTIMIZEenvironment variable in CPython.This turns any assert statement into a null-operation: the assertionssimply get compiled away and won’t be evaluated, which means thatnone of the conditional expressions will be executed.
  
This is an intentional design decision used similarly by many other
programming languages. As a side-effect, it becomes extremely dangerous to use assert statements as a quick and easy way to validate
input data.
Let me explain—if your program uses asserts to check if a function
argument contains a “wrong” or unexpected value, this can backfire
quickly and lead to bugs or security holes.
Let’s take a look at a simple example that demonstrates this problem. Again, imagine you’re building an online store application with
Python. Somewhere in your application code there’s a function to
delete a product as per a user’s request.
Because you just learned about assertions, you’re eager to use them
in your code (hey, I know I would be!) and you write the following
implementation:
  
``` python
def delete_product(prod_id, user):
    assert user.is_admin(), 'Must be admin'
    assert store.has_product(prod_id), 'Unknown product'
    store.get_product(prod_id).delete()
```
  
Take a close look at this delete_product function. Now, what’s going
to happen if assertions are disabled?
There are two serious issues in this three-line function example, and
they’re caused by the incorrect use of assert statements:
  
1. Checking for admin privileges with an assert statement is dangerous. If assertions are disabled in the Python
interpreter, this turns into a null-op. Therefore any user can
now delete products. The privileges check doesn’t even run.
This likely introduces a security problem and opens the door
for attackers to destroy or severely damage the data in our
online store. Not good.
  
2. The has_product() check is skipped when assertions
are disabled. This means get_product() can now be called
with invalid product IDs—which could lead to more severe
bugs, depending on how our program is written. In the worst
case, this could be an avenue for someone to launch Denial of
Service attacks against our store. For example, if the store app
crashes if someone attempts to delete an unknown product,
an attacker could bombard it with invalid delete requests and
cause an outage.
How might we avoid these problems? The answer is to never use assertions to do data validation. Instead, we could do our validation
with regular if-statements and raise validation exceptions if necessary, like so:

``` python
def delete_product(product_id, user):
if not user.is_admin():
raise AuthError('Must be admin to delete')
if not store.has_product(product_id):
raise ValueError('Unknown product id')
store.get_product(product_id).delete()
```

This updated example also has the benefit that instead of raising unspecific AssertionError exceptions, it now raises semantically correct exceptions like ValueError or AuthError (which we’d have to
define ourselves.)

<h5 dir='rt1'>Caveat #2 – Asserts That Never Fail</h5>
  
It’s surprisingly easy to accidentally write Python assert statements
that always evaluate to true. I’ve been bitten by this myself in the past.
Here’s the problem, in a nutshell:
When you pass a tuple as the first argument in an assert statement,
the assertion always evaluates as true and therefore never fails.

For example, this assertion will never fail:

``` python
assert(1 == 2, 'This should fail')
```

This has to do with non-empty tuples always being truthy in Python. If
you pass a tuple to an assert statement, it leads to the assert condition
always being true—which in turn leads to the above assert statement
being useless because it can never fail and trigger an exception.
It’s relatively easy to accidentally write bad multi-line asserts due to
this, well, unintuitive behavior. For example, I merrily wrote a bunch
of broken test cases that gave a false sense of security in one of my test
suites. Imagine you had this assertion in one of your unit tests:
  
``` python
assert (
counter == 10,
'It should have counted all the items'
)
```

Upon first inspection, this test case looks completely fine. However, it
would never catch an incorrect result: the assertion always evaluates
to True, regardless of the state of the counter variable. And why is
that? Because it asserts the truth value of a tuple object.
Like I said, it’s rather easy to shoot yourself in the foot with this (mine
still hurts). A good countermeasure you can apply to prevent this syntax quirk from causing trouble is to use a code linter.4 Newer versions
of Python 3 will also show a syntax warning for these dubious asserts.
By the way, that’s also why you should always do a quick smoke test
with your unit test cases. Make sure they can actually fail before you
move on to writing the next one.

  
<h5 dir='rt1'>Python Assertions — Summary</h5>
  
Despite these caveats I believe that Python’s assertions are a powerful
debugging tool that’s frequently underused by Python developers.
Understanding how assertions work and when to apply them can help
you write Python programs that are more maintainable and easier to
debug.
It’s a great skill to learn that will help bring your Python knowledge to
the next level and make you a more well-rounded Pythonista. I know
it has saved me hours upon hours of debugging.

<h5 dir='rt1'>Key Takeaways</h5>
  
   • Python’s assert statement is a debugging aid that tests a condition as an internal self-check in your program.
   • Asserts should only be used to help developers identify bugs.
   They’re not a mechanism for handling run-time errors.
   • Asserts can be globally disabled with an interpreter setting.
